Lots of new stuff announced for SEO announced this year at I/O ranging from Structured Data, Website Performance and User Experience. So let's just jump into it.

### Googlebot now crawls Javascript sites üéâ

The Googlebot (which crawls all your webpages for content) will use the **latest Chromium** rendering engine. If you, like me, had reservations for using javascript frameworks like [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) in fear of bad SEO, now is the time to get on it. 

I tested some pages with heavy javascript using Gatsby.js which Google indexed perfectly. And the bot will also regularly update its rendering engine to match the latest Chromium.

### New Structured Data, FAQ and How-to üÜï

Why doesn't Google call it a Schema? Anyway they now support two new "Structured Data", FAQ and How-to

**FAQ**: An FAQ page provides a list of frequently asked questions and answers on a particular topic.

**How-to**: How-to rich results provide users with richer previews of web results that guide users through step-by-step tasks.
