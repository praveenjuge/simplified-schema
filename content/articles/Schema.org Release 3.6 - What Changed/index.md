This release was a maintenance release of sorts, having a couple of typo fixes, site improvements, and some good documentation enhancements.

### New Schema?
This release **didn't** have any new schema's.

### Other Mildly Interesting Changes
- Restored [estimatedSalary](https://schema.org/estimatedSalary) as a property expected on the [JobPosting](/schema/job-posting/) type. No idea why it was removed.
- Made [CatholicChurch](https://schema.org/CatholicChurch) subclass of [Church](https://schema.org/Church).
- Corrected duration format in examples for [timeRequired](https://schema.org/timeRequired).
- Updated text to correctly quote Princess Leia in example for [spokenByCharacter](https://schema.org/spokenByCharacter) property. Which was very important.

You can see a full list of what changed in the schema [releases page](https://schema.org/docs/releases.html) and 3.6 full release summary [here](https://schema.org/version/3.6/schema-all.html).
