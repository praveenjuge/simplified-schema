# About this Site
---
We made this site so that we can easily use Structured Data content for every website we make.

We would love for you to contribute what you know about Schema. You can make a pull request in this [Github Repo](https://github.com/praveenjuge/simplified-schema/). All the Schema content is in Markdown format located at `content/schema` folder.

Lots of testing has been done on the Schema available on this site but we could be wrong in some places. If you find any errors you can easily raise a [GitHub issue here](https://github.com/praveenjuge/simplified-schema/issues/).
