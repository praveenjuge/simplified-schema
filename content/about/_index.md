# About this Site
---
I made this site so that I can easily use Structured Data content for every website I make.

I would love for you to contribute what you know about Schema. You can make a pull request in this [Github Repo](https://github.com/praveenjuge/simplified-schema/). All the Schema content is in Markdown format located at `content/schema` folder.

Lots of testing has been done on the Schema available on this site but I could be wrong in some places. If you find any errors you can easily raise a [GitHub issue here](https://github.com/praveenjuge/simplified-schema/issues/).
